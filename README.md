Ceol Mor Club

This page contains a number of pibroch (or piobaireachd) scores and other resources, which I have made available for educational purposes. 

These materials are intended to complement the 1-2-1 tuition of private students and are included here for the purposes of study and discussion. 

I assert no ownership on any of the materials enclosed within and they are hosted here in line with non-commercial exceptions allowed under copyright law ('fair use', with education being the purpose; 'limited use', with conversative and sparing use of copyright material when it is actually utilised; and 'acknowledgement' with all sources are included and original authors names left intact where available). 

Thanks go to the original authors and publications from which these excerpts orginate, with the hope that the use of their materials helps promote the further study and performance of ceol mor!
